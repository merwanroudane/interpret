## üìä Key Features

-   **Wide Range of Topics**: Covers everything from basic linear regression to more complex models involving transformations, dummy variables, interaction terms, and polynomials.
-   **Interactive Visualizations**: Uses Plotly to create dynamic charts that visually explain how coefficients affect the model's predictions.
-   **Mathematical Formulas**: Presents the underlying equations for each model using LaTeX for clarity.
-   **Practical Examples**: Includes real-world examples from economics, environmental science, and other fields to contextualize the concepts.
-   **Interactive Playground**: A hands-on section where users can adjust model parameters (intercepts, slopes, interaction terms) and see the immediate impact on the regression line, helping to build intuition.
-   **Custom Styling**: Features a clean and organized layout with custom CSS for an enhanced user experience.

## üìö Sections Covered

The application is organized into the following sections, accessible via a sidebar:

1.  **Introduction**: An overview of the importance of correct coefficient interpretation.
2.  **Linear Regression Basics**: Covers the interpretation of coefficients in simple and multiple linear regression (Level-Level models).
3.  **Log Transformations**: Explains interpretation for:
    -   Log-Level models (`ln(Y) ~ X`)
    -   Level-Log models (`Y ~ ln(X)`)
    -   Log-Log models (`ln(Y) ~ ln(X)`)
4.  **Dummy Variables**: Details on how to interpret coefficients for binary and categorical predictors.
5.  **Log & Dummy Interactions**: Explores more complex models that include interaction terms between continuous, logged, and dummy variables.
6.  **Polynomial Terms**: Describes how to interpret coefficients in quadratic and cubic models, focusing on marginal effects.
7.  **Practical Examples**: Applies the concepts to datasets in different domains, showing how to synthesize interpretations from multiple coefficients.
8.  **Interactive Playground**: A sandbox environment to experiment with different models and parameters in real-time.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to run the application on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8 or higher
-   `pip` (Python package installer)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository** (or download the source files):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
    cd your-repository-name
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment** (recommended):
    -   **On macOS and Linux:**
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    -   **On Windows:**
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies** using the `requirements.txt` file:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Application

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the Streamlit app with the following command:

```bash
streamlit run intr.py
```

Your default web browser will open a new tab with the running application, typically at `http://localhost:8501`.
